# UK Driving Test Analytics
In the UK, we have a pretty tough driving test, the target pass rate for examination centres is something above `40%`, but obviously not something too high!

## Observations
A study was performed at a test centre where they asked candidates that had just passed their test to retest the next day, this test would not effect their newly found license, however they could still 'fail' this test.

It was found that only 40% of the people, who passed their test the day before, passed it again the next day.  I believe this is evidence to show that the driving tests are most likely **independent of driving ability**.
